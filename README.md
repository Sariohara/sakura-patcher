# sakura-patcher
Unoffical Application to patch your sakura games

I created this for myself after buying the budle on steam I noticed that there are adult content patches available for some games.
Because it's a pain in the ass to patch all games manually I wanted to make a application to do it for me and possibly for you.

All content is provided by the official Winged Cloud Patreon [https://www.patreon.com/wingedcloud](https://www.patreon.com/wingedcloud)  
I don't own any game content!

## Getting started

Install the latest version of [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). After installing Python open a Command Prompt or Terminal.  
Install the dependencies:  

    python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you can run the program like this:

    python sakura-patcher.py 

Choose your file path. For me the games are in this directory:
    
    K:\Steam\steamapps\common

After selecting the games you want to have patched, click "Patch selected" and wait :)

This is the first version that has a GUI so there will be bugs.
Downloading the patches might take a while because some of the files are quite large (~150MB) and varying download speeds.

Please check out [https://github.com/GaryWatsonUK/py-wetransfer](https://github.com/GaryWatsonUK/py-wetransfer) for supplying me with a wetransfer download(er)

### Existing Files will be renamed to [filename].rpa-copy

Although content you already unlocked will not be deleted, I wanted to make sure to keep the old files around if you ever wanna easily revert the changes.
